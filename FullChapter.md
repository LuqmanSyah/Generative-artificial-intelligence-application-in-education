## 2. Theoretical Foundations

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to produce new content, such as text, images, audio, or code, often indistinguishable from human-created material. Core concepts include large language models (LLMs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and multimodal AI systems. The historical development of GenAI in education can be traced from early rule-based systems and computer-assisted instruction to today’s sophisticated neural networks capable of adaptive and creative outputs. Relevant learning theories underpinning GenAI’s educational use include constructivism, which emphasizes active, personalized learning, and the theory of personalized learning, which advocates for tailoring educational experiences to individual needs. GenAI aligns with these theories by enabling adaptive content and learner-centered approaches.

In addition to constructivism and personalized learning, the integration of GenAI in education draws upon sociocultural theory, which emphasizes the importance of social interaction and cultural context in the learning process. GenAI-powered tools can facilitate collaborative learning environments, enabling students to engage in dialogue, co-create knowledge, and participate in communities of practice that extend beyond the traditional classroom. This aligns with Vygotsky’s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, where intelligent agents can provide timely scaffolding and support, helping learners achieve higher levels of understanding and skill.

Another foundational perspective is the theory of connectivism, which posits that learning occurs through networks of information, people, and digital resources. GenAI systems exemplify this by connecting learners to vast repositories of knowledge, generating personalized pathways, and adapting to evolving educational needs. By leveraging data analytics and real-time feedback, GenAI not only supports individual learning trajectories but also contributes to the collective intelligence of educational communities. These theoretical foundations underscore the transformative potential of GenAI to redefine how knowledge is constructed, shared, and applied in contemporary education.
