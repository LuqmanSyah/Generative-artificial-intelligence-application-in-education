## 2. Theoretical Foundations

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to produce new content, such as text, images, audio, or code, often indistinguishable from human-created material. Core concepts include large language models (LLMs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and multimodal AI systems. The historical development of GenAI in education can be traced from early rule-based systems and computer-assisted instruction to today’s sophisticated neural networks capable of adaptive and creative outputs. Relevant learning theories underpinning GenAI’s educational use include constructivism, which emphasizes active, personalized learning, and the theory of personalized learning, which advocates for tailoring educational experiences to individual needs. GenAI aligns with these theories by enabling adaptive content and learner-centered approaches.

In addition to constructivism and personalized learning, the integration of GenAI in education draws upon sociocultural theory, which emphasizes the importance of social interaction and cultural context in the learning process. GenAI-powered tools can facilitate collaborative learning environments, enabling students to engage in dialogue, co-create knowledge, and participate in communities of practice that extend beyond the traditional classroom. This aligns with Vygotsky’s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, where intelligent agents can provide timely scaffolding and support, helping learners achieve higher levels of understanding and skill.

Another foundational perspective is the theory of connectivism, which posits that learning occurs through networks of information, people, and digital resources. GenAI systems exemplify this by connecting learners to vast repositories of knowledge, generating personalized pathways, and adapting to evolving educational needs. By leveraging data analytics and real-time feedback, GenAI not only supports individual learning trajectories but also contributes to the collective intelligence of educational communities. These theoretical foundations underscore the transformative potential of GenAI to redefine how knowledge is constructed, shared, and applied in contemporary education.

### Agentic vs. Non-Agentic Frameworks

The distinction between agentic and non-agentic AI frameworks is critical in shaping educational experiences. Understanding these differences helps institutions select the most appropriate AI solutions for their pedagogical goals and operational needs:

- **Agentic AI Systems:** These systems are characterized by their autonomy, adaptability, and ability to make decisions based on real-time data and learner interactions. Agentic AI can interpret complex learner input, set personalized goals, and take proactive actions to support individual learning journeys without requiring constant human oversight. For example, intelligent tutoring systems can dynamically adjust the difficulty of questions, provide tailored hints, or recommend supplementary resources based on a student’s performance and engagement. AI-powered agents can also monitor student progress, identify misconceptions, and intervene with targeted feedback or scaffolding at the optimal moment. The agentic nature of these systems enables a high degree of personalization, interactivity, and responsiveness, making them well-suited for supporting diverse learners and fostering self-regulated learning. However, their complexity requires careful design to ensure transparency, prevent unintended consequences, and maintain alignment with educational values. Institutions must also consider the need for explainability, as agentic systems may make decisions that are not immediately understandable to users.

- **Non-Agentic (Rule-Based) Systems:** These systems operate strictly according to predefined rules, scripts, or decision trees, offering limited adaptability to individual learner needs. Non-agentic systems are typically reliable, predictable, and easier to audit, as their behavior is fully determined by explicit programming. For example, a rule-based quiz generator might present the same set of questions to all students or provide feedback based solely on correct or incorrect answers, without considering the learner’s broader context or learning history. While this approach ensures consistency and control, it lacks the flexibility to respond dynamically to unique learning challenges or preferences. Non-agentic systems are often preferred in situations where transparency, simplicity, and regulatory compliance are paramount, or where resources for ongoing system maintenance and monitoring are limited. However, they may not provide the depth of support, engagement, or personalization that agentic AI can offer, potentially limiting their effectiveness in complex or rapidly changing educational environments.

**Comparative Implications:**

- **Scalability:** Agentic AI systems excel in scaling personalized learning experiences across large and diverse student populations. By leveraging automation and adaptive algorithms, these systems can deliver individualized interventions, feedback, and resources to thousands of learners simultaneously, without overwhelming human educators. This scalability is particularly valuable in online or blended learning environments, where teacher-to-student ratios are high. In contrast, non-agentic systems, which rely on static rules and limited adaptability, often require more manual oversight and intervention from educators to address individual needs, making them less efficient for large-scale deployment.

- **User Trust and Transparency:** Trust is a critical factor in the adoption of AI in education. Non-agentic systems, with their rule-based and predictable behavior, are generally easier for users to understand, audit, and trust. Their decision-making processes are transparent, allowing educators and students to see exactly how outcomes are determined. Agentic systems, while offering greater personalization and responsiveness, can sometimes appear as “black boxes” due to their complex, data-driven decision-making. Building trust in agentic AI requires robust explainability features, clear communication about how the system operates, and mechanisms for users to question or override AI decisions when necessary. Transparent design and ongoing user education are essential to foster confidence in these advanced systems.

- **Educational Outcomes:** The impact of AI frameworks on learning outcomes is significant. Agentic AI has the potential to enhance learner engagement, motivation, and achievement by providing timely, adaptive support tailored to each student’s needs and progress. These systems can identify learning gaps, offer targeted interventions, and encourage self-regulated learning, leading to improved academic performance and deeper understanding. However, the complexity of agentic systems introduces challenges in monitoring their effectiveness, ensuring ethical use, and preventing unintended consequences such as over-reliance on automation or reduced human interaction. Rigorous evaluation, continuous improvement, and ethical oversight are necessary to maximize the benefits and mitigate the risks associated with agentic AI in education. Non-agentic systems, while more limited in adaptability, provide consistency and reliability, which can be advantageous in certain instructional contexts or regulatory environments.
